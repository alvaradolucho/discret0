The samples for LM-1 were recorded and generously provided by Alex Ball. Unfortunately the unit that Alex sampled was a bit damaged so Alex was not able to get samples of the toms from the LM-1 and so has provided samples from his personal Oberheim DX drum machine, which has a similar sound to the LM-1.
